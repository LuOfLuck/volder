# Volder Online

Volder Online is to site web elaborated for unify the activites in to schools of way digital, without the need to require external applications, imitating the models of the secundari schools.


**_¿why we created Volder?_** 
during the process pandemic we realized what the info inside the schools it was lost, it was very slow and poorly optimized because of this we decided to de develop in site web for solve these problems


 **_¿How did we do it?_**
we decided that volder will imitate the models of the secundari schools through a hierarchy system where each user is within one of them and the hierarchies are:
- student
- lecturer
- teacher
- secretary

to prevent anyone outside the school from having access we decided not to use the normal registration form but to use a manual registration form based on hierarchies. Here is a context diagram that explains how it works

in this way we divide the work of adding everyone between secretaries and preceptor, ensuring that all members of the school are within Volder.


Once that is done, the true Volder operation can take place. Like the classic upload / receive jobs from a lecturer. Context diagram about that system:
